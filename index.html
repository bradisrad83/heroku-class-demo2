			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="stuff/images/brad.jpg" alt="myself" style="width: 150px; height: 178px">
				<p>Hello there from the interweb.  My name is Bradley Goldsmith and it's nice to meet you, well sort of.  I go by Brad and am at the ripe young age of 33.  I currently am enrolled in a six month bootcamp in web developement so that I can better myself.  From what you must be asking yourself, well if you must know I have been bartedning for the past million or so years, nine to be specific but hey who's counting, I guess me.  Anyways sorry to get off of subject but I feel as though it's time for a change and boom here I am.  
			<br>
				<p>I love music and I live for seeing live shows and going to festivals.  It truly is my passion, who knows maybe one day I'll be able to incorporate it into my career.  Other hobbies of mine include disc golf and photography.  I have the two best dogs anywone could ever ask for.  I guess that kind of sums me up.  Any other questions or concerns, inquire within.
