    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>Widespread Panic is an American rock band from Athens, Georgia. The current lineup includes guitarist/singer John Bell, bassist Dave Schools, drummer Duane Trucks, percussionist Domingo "Sunny" Ortiz, keyboardist John "JoJo" Hermann, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. Michael Houser and George McConnell have also played lead guitar for the band, Todd Nance retired in 2016 as their original drummer.  Since their inception in Athens, Georgia, in 1986, Widespread Panic has risen to elite status among American jam bands.  Following in the steps of other Southern rock jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, they draw influences from the Southern rock, blues-rock, progressive rock, funk and hard rock genres. They are frequently compared to other jam band "road warriors" such as the Grateful Dead and Phish.  Widely renowned for their live performances, as of 2015, they hold the record for number of sold-out performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre (Morrison, Colorado) at 51 and Philips Arena (Atlanta, Georgia) at 20.</p>
